Misc Tools

upload_s3:
Tool for uploading files to S3.  A little more bare than some of the other
tools out there, but does something many of them don't: gzips files of certain
extensions and sets content encoding.  It also will re-upload files that could
be gzipped that haven't before, while ignoring already gzipped files or ones
not included in the list to be compressed.
Note: Currently requires a little patch for boto to work (boto_patch.txt).
