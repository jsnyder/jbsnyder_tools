Misc Tools

upload_s3:
Tool for uploading files to S3.  A little more bare than some of the other
tools out there, but does something many of them don't: gzips files of certain
extensions and sets content encoding.  It also will re-upload files that could
be gzipped that haven't before, while ignoring already gzipped files or ones
not included in the list to be compressed.

accmouse:
This script allows one to control mouse movement on a Mac OS X machine using an
accelerometer (LIS2L02AS4) connected to an Arduino running Firmata. movemouse.m
must be compiled in order to control mouse movements. Also, pyduino is needed in
order to talk to Firmata: http://code.google.com/p/pyduino/
